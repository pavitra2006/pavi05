        <h1>What is GitHub ?</h1>
        <p>
            GitHub is a widely-used Free-to-use cloud Storage platform with version control and many other essential features that specifically helps developers to manage and deploy their projects on GitHub.
            
            Benefits of Using Git
            History Tracking: Git allows you to track every change made in your project, including: who made the change and when it was made.
            Collaboration: Multiple developers can be able work on the same project at the same time, and Git efficiently manages the merging of changes in code.
            Branching and Merging: Git enables developers to create branches to work on new features or bug fixes and later merge them back into the main codebase.
            Offline Work: Git works offline, which means you can commit changes and work on your project even without an internet connection</p>

            Git is a fast, scalable, distributed revision control system with an unusually rich command set that provides both high-level operations and full access to internals.

See gittutorial[7] to get started, then see giteveryday[7] for a useful minimum set of commands. The Git Userâ€™s Manual has a more in-depth introduction.

After you mastered the basic concepts, you can come back to this page to learn what commands Git offers. You can learn more about individual Git commands with "git help command". gitcli[7] manual page gives you an overview of the command-line command syntax.
